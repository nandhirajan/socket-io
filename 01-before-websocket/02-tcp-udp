- Data transfer between client and server will be done via data packets
- Data packets using TCP protocols
- Packets have below layers
  - Application -> HTTP/FTP/SSH/SMTP
  - Transport -> TCP/UDP (TCP/IP)
  - Network -> IP (TCP/IP)
  - Link -> Ethernet, wifi
  - Physical -> Cables 
  
Transport layouer uses 2^16 ports -> 	65,536 ports
Node js uses one of the port 3000 in local
Application layer hand over the request to Transport layer ( with source and destination port ) to establish the connection
  
UDP:
- Lightweight, only 8 bytes
- Connection less. No need to maintain the connection between Client and Server
- Send data no matter what!
- What happens if data lose. It won't care
